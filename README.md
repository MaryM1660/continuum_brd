# Continuum — Executive Summary

## What it is

**Continuum** is an AI-powered career development platform for mid-career professionals. It combines a mobile voice coaching app with a web-based career management workspace.

The mobile app acts as a personal AI career coach — you talk to it, it listens, asks questions, and builds your structured career profile over time through natural conversation.

The web platform turns that profile into a job search strategy: structured career plans, targeted resumes, gap assessments, application tracking, and interview preparation.

## The Problem

Mid-career professionals struggle with job searching not because they can't find jobs — but because they start the process wrong:

- No clear career strategy (reactive, not proactive)
- Generic resumes sent to every position
- No structured record of achievements (hard to articulate value under interview pressure)
- No way to measure whether they're "ready" to start searching
- Fragmented process: notes in random places, forgotten follow-ups, no system

The result: wasted time, missed opportunities, low confidence, poor match rates.

## The Insight

**The bottleneck isn't job searching — it's career preparation.**

Most people start looking for a job when they need one. By then it's too late to build a strong profile. The people who get great jobs are those who spent years (consciously or not) building their story — clear articulation of achievements, a defined career direction, a network-ready narrative.

Continuum makes this process systematic and accessible to everyone, not just those lucky enough to have great coaches or mentors.

## The Solution

### Mobile: AI Voice Coach
A conversational AI coach you talk to on your phone. It asks questions, helps you reflect, and extracts structured career data from your answers:
- XYZ achievement statements ("I accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z")
- STARL behavioral stories (Situation → Task → Action → Result → Learning)
- Career plan insights and direction
- Skill evidence and examples

Sessions are voice-first, natural, and low-friction — like talking to a coach.

### Web: Career Management Workspace
A web platform where all the structured data from coaching sessions becomes actionable:
- **Career strategy**: 4-plan framework (Ideal, Real, Compromise, Anti)
- **Ideal Profile**: built from real vacancy analysis — what the market actually wants
- **Gap Assessment**: your skills vs. what the market wants
- **Resume Studio**: build targeted resume versions from your achievement bank
- **Pipeline**: track all applications in one place
- **Interview Prep**: STARL stories mapped to competencies tested in each role

The coaching data flows automatically from mobile into the web workspace via **Voice Inbox**.
