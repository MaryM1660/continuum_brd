# Voice Session Mechanics

## Overview

The voice session is the core interaction on mobile. It's a real-time conversation between the user and an AI career coach. The coach asks questions, the user answers, and structured career data is extracted in the background.

***

## Session Lifecycle

```
1. PRE-SESSION
   ─────────────────────────────────
   User taps "Talk" or "Start session"
   Coach context loaded from backend:
     - Previous session summaries
     - Current Career Profile state (what's missing)
     - Active target (Real Plan + Ideal Profile)
     - Pending follow-ups from last session

2. SESSION OPENING
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Coach greets (uses user's name)
   Coach sets context or asks opening question
   Microphone activates

3. ACTIVE CONVERSATION
   ─────────────────────────────────
   User speaks → STT converts to text
   LLM processes user text in context of full conversation
   Coach responds (text → TTS → audio output)
   AI extraction pipeline runs in background:
     - Identifies XYZ candidates
     - Identifies STARL threads
     - Flags plan insights
     - Notes skill evidence

4. SESSION END
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Triggered by:
     - User taps stop button
     - Session time limit reached (paywall trigger — TBD)
     - Network interruption

5. POST-SESSION
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Session summary generated
   Extracted items synced to backend
   Voice Inbox updated on web
   Summary screen shown to user
```

## The Talk Screen

The main UI during a session:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                      │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │            Waveform             │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                      │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │  "Do you want me to start?"     │ │  ← Optional, only when needed
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ Yes, please                     │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ I have a topic                  │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘ │                                  
│                                      │
│                                      │
│                                      │
│                                      │
│           ┌───────────┐              │
│[⏸ Pause] │  ●  MIC   │ [⏹ End] │    │  ← Primary CTA (large, pulsing when talking)
│           └───────────┘              │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**States of the mic button:**

* Idle: static button, "Tap to start"
* Recording: pulsing animation + audio waveform
* Coach speaking: audio waveform
* Processing: loading indicator

***

## Teleprompter Mode

The Teleprompter Panel is an optional overlay that shows the coach's question/prompt as large text on screen. Designed for:

* Hands-free use (phone propped up, user talks while walking/commuting)
* Users who prefer reading the question while formulating their answer
* Accessibility (hearing coach audio might be difficult in noisy environments)

**Toggle:** Small button on Talk Screen. Opens as a panel overlay, semi-transparent.

## How the Coach Works

### Context the Coach Has

* Full career profile to date (XYZ bank, STARL bank, plans)
* All previous session summaries
* Active target (Real Plan + Ideal Profile)
* Ideal Profile must-haves (knows what's still missing in coverage)
* Gap Assessment state (knows which skills are weak)

### Coach Behavior

The coach is **proactive and structured** — it has a plan. It doesn't wait for the user to know what to say.

**Principles:**

1. **Always have a goal for the session.** Coach starts with an intent (e.g., "Today I want to try to capture 2 more XYZ achievements from your DataFlow experience").
2. **Ask one question at a time.** No overwhelming multi-part questions.
3. **Drill down for specifics.** If user gives a vague answer ("We improved performance"), coach asks for the number ("What was the actual improvement? Any benchmarks?").
4. **Use the STARL frame.** When user tells a story, coach guides through S→T→A→R→L without making it feel like an interview.
5. **Reference previous sessions.** "Last time you mentioned the migration project — I'd love to dig into that more today."
6. **End with synthesis.** At end of session, briefly recaps what was captured.

### Topics the Coach Covers

Rotates based on what the Career Profile needs most:

* Work achievements (XYZ mining)
* Behavioral stories (STARL development)
* Career plans (calibration, horizon discussion)
* Target role research (what does the user know about their target?)
* Skill gaps (evidence gathering for weak areas)
* Interview preparation (practice questions for upcoming interviews)
* Market insights (what the user is seeing in their job search)

## Document Upload During Session

> **Status: Open question** — UX not yet designed. See [Open Questions](../open-questions.md).

Documents that can be shared with the coach:

* User's current resume (coach can reference specific roles, help update language)
* A job posting (coach can identify gaps, prep questions for that specific role)
* A performance review (coach can help translate to XYZ/STARL)

**Candidate UX patterns:**

* A) User says "I want to talk about my resume" → coach asks "Can you share it?" → upload button appears
* B) Persistent paper clip icon on Talk Screen → taps anytime to upload
* C) Upload happens before session starts (in pre-session setup screen)

## Session Summary Screen

Shown after every session:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
