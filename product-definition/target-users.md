## User Archetype

Beyond Alex, the product serves a specific archetype:

### Who They Are
- Mid-career professional (4–10 years experience)
- Aware that they've grown professionally, but their resume and narrative haven't kept up
- Has a rough sense of where they want to go, but lacks a structured strategy
- Sophisticated enough to understand the value of preparation — they just lack the system
- Probably already knows what XYZ and STAR formats are (or can learn quickly)

### Demographics (hypothesis)
- 28–42 years old
- Industries: tech (PM, engineering, design, data), finance, consulting
- Targeting IC→management transitions or company/domain changes
- English-speaking markets initially

### Behavior Patterns
- Thinks about career growth, but only acts during crisis moments (layoff, bad performance review, feeling stuck)
- Has tried Notion/Google Docs templates for career planning — didn't stick
- Has read books about career development (e.g., "Designing Your Life", "The 2-Hour Job Search")
- Uses LinkedIn but feels their profile isn't really "them"
- Would pay for a career coach but $200–400/hour is not sustainable

### Pain Points
1. "I know I've done great work but I can't articulate it well in interviews"
2. "I send applications but don't know why I'm not getting responses"
3. "I don't know if I'm actually ready to switch or if I'm just frustrated"
4. "My resume is from 2 years ago and I haven't updated it"
5. "I've had the idea of switching to fintech for a year but haven't done anything about it"

### Motivation
- **Fear:** Being stuck at the same level while peers advance
- **Aspiration:** The specific next role — concrete, named, clear (not vague "growth")
- **Trigger:** Usually an external event — company change, market news, peer's success
