## Preparing Phase — Weekly Cadence

**Typical weekly loop for a user in Preparing mode:**

### Mobile (3–5x per week)
1. Open app on commute or lunch break
2. Welcome Back screen → [Start session]
3. 15–25 minute coaching session
4. Session summary shows what was captured
5. Items sync to web Voice Inbox

### Web (1–2x per week)
1. Open web platform
2. Voice Inbox badge shows N new items → review them
3. Edit AI-drafted XYZ/STARL as needed
4. Check Readiness Checklist → pick next item to work on
5. Follow "Next Best Step" recommendation
6. Work on Resume Studio (add XYZ, refine STARL, or create resume version)
7. Check Gap Assessment → see if any gaps closed
8. Market Readiness score updates

**Weekly progress expectation:**
- +1–2 XYZ achievements per week
- +0.5–1 STARL story per week
- Market Readiness +3–5% per week (when actively using both platforms)
- Estimated time to 75% readiness: 4–8 weeks depending on starting point

---

## Preparing → Active Transition

**Trigger:** User decides to start applying (driven by readiness threshold or external motivation).

```
Today screen (Preparing) shows banner:
"Ready to start job search"
Gate checklist: ✅ resume version  ✅ gap done  ⚠️ plans
[→ Start job search]

User clicks → confirmation modal:
"You're about to switch to Active mode.
 This will change your daily dashboard to focus on
 applying and tracking applications."
[Start Active search]  [Keep preparing]

Search status changes to Active
Today screen switches to Active mode
```
